 1.2.0 breaking changes
Route builders (so called Route classes) are now standard Camel RouteBuilder descendants not plain classes with configure closure
Route reloading has been removed. Apache Camel does not support route reloading and the existing hack didn't work properly in the latest version of that library.
Since version 1.2.0 this plugin does not use ConfigurationHolder or any other static holders. Therefore it is safe to use it in an environment where on one Tomcat there is more than Grails application running

Overview
========
The grails routing plug-in allows you to send and route messages to a wide variety of destination endpoints directly from a service "CamelMessageService". It also provides a new Grails artifact, Routes, to configure your routes using known Enterprise Integration Patterns via the `Apache Camel` `Java DSL`.

This plugin is a new and updated version of the grails-camel plugin with virtually the same capabilities but it targets Apache Camel 2.9.0 instead.


Creating Routes
===============
To create a new route, use the grails create-route command:

`grails create-route MyMessage`
This will create a route in your grails-app/routes directory:

```java
import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder
class MyMessageRoute extends RouteBuilder {
	def grailsApplication

	@Override
	void configure() {
		def config = grailsApplication?.config

		// example:
		// from('seda:input').to('stream:out')
	}
}
```

In the configure closure you have full access to the `Camel Java DSL` to configure your message routes.


Route Configuration
==============
#####Simple Example
To create a route from an in-memory queue called "input.queue" to stdout, use:

```java
from("seda:input.queue").to("stream:out")
```

This would print out any Object sent to "seda:input.queue" to the console.

#####Slightly More Complex Example
Suppose you wanted to send messages asynchronously to the following Grails Service:

```java
class MyService {
    def myMethod(fooBarText) {
        log.info "Got text: ${ fooBarText }"
    }
}
```

Using Camel's bean integration, we can deliver messages directly to any Grails Service:

```java
from("seda:input.queue").filter {
    it.in.body.contains("FooBar")
}.to("bean:myService?method=myMethod")
```

This would deliver any message with the text "FooBar" in the body to the myMethod method of the myService service.

This example also illustrates one of the routing enhancements the plug-in offers. You can pass a Closure to the "filter", "when" and "process" `DSL` methods.


Receiving emails from GMail
===========================
To receive emails from a GMail account is quite simple with Apache Camel and its camel-mail component. Here's what you need to do:

Enable IMap access to the GMail account you want to check (How to is here)

Add the necessary runtime dependency to Camel Mail component in BuildConfig.groovy

`runtime 'org.apache.camel:camel-mail:2.12.1'`
Follow the instructions on Apache Camel Mail component documentation page to setup the route

Hot reloading
=============
If you want your service classes or beans to be hot reloadable DO NOT use

`static transactional=true`

in your service class. This is a known limitation as of now and will not work.


Sending Messages
================
The plug-in provides a new service, CamelMessageService, with the following methods:

"sendMessage", for sending messages to endpoints. It accepts a String endpoint and an Object message:

```java
def myMessage = [name:"foo",data:"bar"]
sendMessage("seda:input.queue", myMessage)
```

This would send the Map "myMessage" to an in-memory queue called "input.queue".

If you need to send a message with headers you can use the following construct:

```java
def myMessage = "The content of my message"
sendMessageAndHeaders("seda:input.queue", myMessage, [ header1: "value", header2: 2 ])
```

To send messages with attachments (e.g. e-mails with attachments), you can use the following method:

```java
def myMessage = "The content of my message"
sendMessageAndHeadersAndAttachments("seda:input.queue", myMessage, [ header1: "value", header2: 2 ],
	[
             "test.png": new DataHandler( new FileDataSource("test.png") )
	]
)
```


Configuration
==============
In order to be able to run multiple applications utilizing this plugin in one JVM you're going to need to change the ID of the camel context bean. You can do so in your Config.groovy like this:

`grails.routing.camelContextId = 'hello'`

#####Configuring additional parameters (available as of 1.2.8)

```java
grails.routing.useMDCLogging = true
grails.routing.streamCache = true
grails.routing.trace = true
```

#####Configuring thread pool (available as of 1.2.2)

Up until now only the default configuration was available (as per official docs):

```xml
<threadPoolProfile id="defaultThreadPoolProfile" defaultProfile="true"
                       poolSize="10" maxPoolSize="20" maxQueueSize="1000"
                       rejectedPolicy="CallerRuns"/>
```

Currently the default options are maintained as per that definition but the following options can be specified in Config.groovy to override the defaults:

```java
grails.routing.threadPoolProfileConfig.poolSize
grails.routing.threadPoolProfileConfig.maxPoolSize
grails.routing.threadPoolProfileConfig.maxQueueSize
grails.routing.threadPoolProfileConfig.rejectedPolicy
```

Using Camel and ActiveMQ for JMS Messaging
To use JMS messaging use the routing-jms plugin. It provides all the required artifacts right out of the box and makes integrating JMS messaging a breeze.


Camel Components
================
Apache Camel has a wide variety of built-in Components for message delivery, such as JMS, SMTP, Web Services and Jabber. Take a look at the [Apache Camel documentation](http://camel.apache.org/components.html) for a comprehensive list. By default the following components are included:

`camel-groovy`, `camel-stream`

Including further components is as easy as adding a reference to the BuildConfig.groovy file as follows:
`runtime("org.apache.camel:camel-ftp:2.12.1")`
This will include full support for `ftp://` endpoints in your application's routing facilities. For a complete list of available components see the Apache Camel documentation

Unit Testing
============
You can extend `CamelTestSupport` class to perform testing of your routes. 
#####Important notice: 
By default `CamelTestSupport#createCamelContext` method creates new `DefaultCamelContext`. To prevent it and make it possible to `bind` existing camelContext created by plugin to CamelTestSupport you should override createCamelContext method like this:

```java
class TestRouteTests extends CamelTestSupport {

  CamelContext camelContext
  ProducerTemplate producerTemplate

  protected CamelContext createCamelContext() throws Exception {
    return camelContext;
  }

  @Test
  void testSomething() {
    def mockEndpoint
    mockEndpoint = getMockEndpoint('mock:bar')

    mockEndpoint.expectedMessageCount(1)
    producerTemplate.sendBody('direct:foo', "Hello World")

    assertMockEndpointsSatisfied()
  }
}
```

Ready to use examples
======================
Here you'll find a simplistic example with just one controller (HomeController) and just one action (the index action) that when invoked will send a message to an internal queue (seda:input) which will then be routed to standard output (stream:out)

Here is another simplistic example to demonstrate the integration with Quartz plugin. The ExampleJob is executed every 5 seconds and sends a message to the internal queue (seda:input) which will then be routed to standard output (stream:out)

### After fork:

* Update Camel from 2.9.2 to 2.11.0
* Support Spring Security

### Configuration for Spring Security:

* You've Spring Security plugin installed.
* Config.groovy. e.g.

<code>
grails.routing {
      	useSpringSecurity= true
      	authorizationPolicies = [
      		[id : 'camelUser', access : 'ROLE_USER'],
      		[id : 'camelAdmin', access : 'ROLE_ADMIN']
      	]
      }
</code>

Note that if I use id with name 'user', there's problem with my Grails app. So, I recommend to use unique id, perhaps adding some prefix.
Access is role name. if multiple roles, separate it by comma. I haven't tried it though.

* create-route route.name.here
* Add route configuration. The following is example, where it calls services.
<code>
        from('seda:admin').policy('camelAdmin').to('bean:loggingService?method=logUser')
        from('seda:user').policy('camelUser').to('bean:loggingService?method=logUser')
        from('seda:anyuser').to('bean:loggingService?method=logAnonym')
</code>
* To send message you can do something like
<code>
sendMessageWithAuth("seda:${springSecurityService.authentication.name}", msg, SecurityContextHolder.context.authentication )
</code>
